# 🌸 CSS Flower Animation

## 🧠 About the Project
When I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/NanouuSymeon/status/1685500463477927936" src="link">this leaf</a>, I wondered how to turn it into a flower, and I tried. <br> Thank you for the inspiration <a href="https://twitter.com/NanouuSymeon" src="link">Nanou</a>, it was a good practice for me as I am a junior developer. <br> <br>
Inspired by a captivating leaf design, this project transforms that inspiration into a blooming flower using only **HTML** and **CSS**. It's a testament to the power of CSS in creating intricate animations and designs without relying on images or JavaScript.
